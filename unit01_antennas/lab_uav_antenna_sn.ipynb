    "# Simulating a 28 GHz antenna for a UAV\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex antennas, it is often necessary to perform detailed EM simulations in third-party software such as HFSS and then import the results into [Nvidia sionna](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/) for analysis. In this lab, we will import HFSS simulation data for a 28 GHz antenna designed for a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle or drone). Antenna modeling is particularly important for mmWave aerial links since the directivity gain is necessary to overcome the high isotropic path loss of mmWave frequencies. Also, UAVs can be an arbitrary orientation and it is important to model the cases when the UAV is out of the beamwidth of the antenna.\n",
    "\n",
    "In going through this lab, you will learn to:\n",
    "* Import data from an EM simulation data\n",
    "* Compute directivity from the E-field values\n",
    "* Create custom antennas that can be used in Nvidia sionna\n",
    "* Display 2D and 3D antenna patterns\n",
    "* Compute the half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of an antenna\n",
    "* Compute fractions of power in angular areas\n",
    "* Estimate the path loss along a path\n",
