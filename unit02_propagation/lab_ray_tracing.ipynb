    "# Ray Tracing and Channel Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation of wireless systems requires simulation in realistic environments.  In modern research, the trend has been use ray tracing where propagation is simulated based on a 3D model of the environment.  A valuable feature of Nvidia's sionna package is that has integrated a [ray tracing module](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html) module that can be used with the communications library to evaluate complex systems in actual environments.  Unfortunately, as you will see in the simulations below, the performance of Sionna is very slow compared to a commercial ray tracer like Remcom's.  Also, on most machines, it can only handle a very limited number of data points.  Still it is an excellent learning tool, easy-to-use, and completely free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nvidia's sionna documentation already has many examples that you can use a template for your work.  In this lab, we will look at a few additional features.  Specifically, in going through this lab, you will learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read and display scene\n",
    "* Create a grid of locations and identify which points are indoor and outdoor\n",
    "* Characterize the link state and plot the link state probability vs distance\n",
    "* Compute the total path loss and plot the path loss vs. distance\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission*: Complete all the sections marked `TODO`, and run the cells to make sure your scipt is working. When you are satisfied with the results,  publish your code to generate an html file. Print the html file to PDF and submit the PDF.\n"

Sionna has a [coverage map](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/rt.html#coverage-maps) class, but I found it to be not very flexible.  So, I wrote a simple class that help create grid points and classify them.  You can create the grid points with the following commands.  In this lab, we use a coarse grid at `10m` spacing.  But, in reality, you would want to make the spacing a little smaller.  I used the `10m` grid only to make this lab run relatively fast.\n",

This method may take a few minutes for a dense grid, but for this experiment it should run in a few seconds since the grid is not very coarse.  Also, to simplify the analysis later, we have the set the bounding box of the grid to a relatively small region of the scene.  If you set, `bbox = None`, it will use the full scene area."
